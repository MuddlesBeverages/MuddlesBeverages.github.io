		<h2>what's a muddle?</h2>	
		
		<p>hello. i’m julian, the founder of muddles beverages ltd. our mission is to make a muddle a thing, i.e. sit alongside the word smoothie as a popular term for spring water blended with fresh fruit. so how the heck are we going to do that?</p>

		<p>well, my background is cocktail bartending. i’ve worked in cocktail bars across the world and was trained by mixologist dre masso (@dremasso), who he taught me about the craft of the cocktail, from muddling fresh ingredients to pairing intricate flavour profiles and presenting a drink with a little flourish.</p>

		<p>fast forward a few years and it was time to take a break from bustling city life and do some travelling. i travelled first to australia and then to vietnam where i’d landed in ho chi minh city with a single mission: drive to hanoi on a motorbike. what i found, aside from a bike with a leaking fuel dump and no third gear, were juice carts on more or less every street corner, all with a fantastic array of fresh, tropical ingredients offering a whole spectrum of delicious flavour profiles. i managed the 3,000km ride in 22 days with one pair of haggard boots, which had survived 3 months working on an australian banana farm, and must have visited a juice cart in every city i visited.</p>

		<p>when i returned to the uk, i created a british interpretation of the vietnamese juice carts and used cocktail methodology to sell muddles at street markets and later to cafes, delis & grocers in london and brighton.</p>
		
		<p>however, fruit & veg juices, smoothies and some coconut water are loaded with fruit sugars that contribute to obesity and diabetes at twice the rate of drinks like coca cola and flavoured water. in fact, 1/4 of adults, 1/5 of children and 1/10 infants in the uk are obese and that sugary drinks are the #1 culprit.</p>
		
		<p>i’ve used my experience in vietnam and my cocktail knowledge to create a range of fruit beverages that offers 1 of your 5 a day but have the lowest level of sugars of any fruit juice available. fact.</p>
		
		<p>so drink less sugar and drink a muddle.</p>
